WODeploy is a combination of scripts that make for easy deployment.

Auto Deployment is handled by the commit hook in:
Resources/opt/subversion/repository/hooks/post-commit

Which does the following:
-Creates a new database
-Creates a new hudson job
-Creates a new JavaMonitor App/Instance (and also adds the arguments: user = deploy and erx rewrite rules to server.com/AppName)
-Adds the rewrite rules server.com/AppName to .htaccess


Deployment is handled by:
Resources/Library/Hudson/Dependencies/deployWOApp.sh
Resources/Library/Hudson/Dependencies/deployWOFramework.sh

Which does the following:
-Versions the previous running app/webserver resources
-Shuts down the current instance
-Installs the current app into the respective directories
-Restarts the app

There are other extras including my scripts for upgrading and downgrading Wonder and WOMonitor (check out Resources/Library/Hudson/jobs).  I also have launchd files for apache, mysql, wotaskd and tomcat (which also requires the script in Resources/usr/local/tomcat/bin/launchd_tomcat.sh.

*I haven't renamed everything for jenkins instead of hudson...
